Macros to enable or disable the Internal 48\+Mhz High Speed oscillator (H\+S\+I48). 

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The H\+S\+I48 is stopped by hardware when entering S\+T\+OP and S\+T\+A\+N\+D\+BY modes. 

H\+S\+I48 can not be stopped if it is used as system clock source. In this case, you have to select another source of the system clock then stop the H\+S\+I14. 

After enabling the H\+S\+I48 with \+\_\+\+\_\+\+H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+R\+C\+C\+\_\+\+H\+S\+I48\+\_\+\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E(), the application software should wait on H\+S\+I48\+R\+DY flag to be set indicating that H\+S\+I48 clock is stable and can be used as system clock source. This is not necessary if H\+A\+L\+\_\+\+R\+C\+C\+\_\+\+Osc\+Config() is used. 

When the H\+S\+I48 is stopped, H\+S\+I48\+R\+DY flag goes low after 6 H\+S\+I48 oscillator clock cycles.
